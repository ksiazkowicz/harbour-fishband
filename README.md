# harbour-fishband
Microsoft Band app for Sailfish OS. Don't bother installing it yet, I'm not 
even sure if I could do it if I had my phone factory reset, with all the 
dependencies.

## What works
- Notifications (mostly)
- Weather
- Syncing time with your phone
- Changing tile colors (not always works)
- Controls from "Music Control" app for Android

## What doesn't work
- Sensors
- Call notifications
- Replying to texts from your Band
- Calendar
- Cortana (obviously)
- and everything else!
